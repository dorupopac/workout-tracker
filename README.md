What this application does:

1. page loads -> the map renders on the user's current location and the workouts found in the localStorage will render
2. user clicks on map -> the workout form renders
3. user submits new workout -> a marker appears on the map, the workout saves in localStorage and renders in the list
4. user clicks on workout in the list -> map moves to the workout location
